# Git basics 

## Initi a repository

to initialize a repository we hace to use the command `git init`
this comand will crate a hidden `.git` sub-folder in the project folder

## Track first changes

First time our files are *untracked*
To start tracking our files we have to `commit` them
To `commit` the files we have the following...

For example, if we have an `index.html` we can start tracking it by doing...

```
git init
git add index.html
git commit -m "first commit"
```
